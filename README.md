# Front end mentor challenge: FAQ accordion card

## Description

- Simple HTML, CSS and JS project with Prettier
- [Front End Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam/hub/faq-accordion-card-_Ae86NKi2V)
- The challenge for this project was to make a Product Preview Card Component that was fully responsive with a mobile-first approach and a JS accordion for the answers to the questions.

## What I've learned

Wow. This one was a doozie. First of all, this was my first project using Javascript and I was a little bit scared beforehand. I had every right to be.

### Step one: Start with the basics, then attack the accordion part.

I hoped to make the accordion using [this W3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp). This was a big failure. Coding the accordion was the easy part. What I struggled with: the _icons and their transformation_. I had no idea I could use a combination of the :active pseudo class and the transform:rotate (); function in order to make my icons moved when scrolling. A bunch of other stuff went wrong, and I was really close to giving up.

### Step two: Starting from scratch.

Every time I thought about this project, I was filled with dread and convinced I would never finish it. And that's why I decided to start again, with a little bit of help on the way. Or rather, a lot of help.
I followed along [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZGpEHgOO8) which, arguably, helped a lot. I learned a bunch of stuff, mainly that variables weren't that scary, and that I didn't need javascript to make an icon rotate. The JS part can be entirely credited to him, because I can't code an accordion on my own quite yet. Before starting, I also felt that following a tutorial was cheating, but I was wrong. There was a lot of problem fixing that came with this project, even with a tutorial, and I know it made me practice my coding a lot. All in all, I'm glad it's over, because I really didn't enjoy myself there.
